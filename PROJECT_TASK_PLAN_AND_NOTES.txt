SEO Tools Platform - Project Task Plan and Work Log
Updated: 2026-02-15

A) Completed in latest cycle (Site Audit Pro)
- Stage 1: Expanded full XLSX tabs with cross-sheet KPIs and actionability signals.
- Stage 2: Calibrated thresholds and added primary URL/schema-type intelligence.
- Stage 3: Added ActionPlan dependency graph and weighted Executive health model.
- Stage 4: Unified KPI/status conditional styling and column anomaly highlighting.
- Hotfix: Fixed XLSX export crash for null `issue.details`.

B) Key commits (main)
- 12d22da  Stage 1 KPIs and signals
- 1232fff  Stage 2 calibration and schema intelligence
- 41bc0bc  Stage 3 dependency graph + weighted health
- 281467e  Stage 4 unified visual styling
- 8aafd4d  Null details export crash fix
- bc915fd  Status cell coloring + anomaly highlights

C) Technical methods applied
1. Centralized report logic in one place:
   - `fill_sheet` became the single point for common formatting.
2. Introduced reusable KPI/status engine:
   - semantic header detection,
   - status derivation from values,
   - palette-based cell styling.
3. Added statistical anomaly layer:
   - per-column quantiles (q90/q97 and q10/q03),
   - highlight outliers when not already explicit warning/error.
4. Improved resilience for heterogeneous data:
   - null-safe conversions,
   - defensive checks for malformed issue rows.
5. Continuous validation discipline:
   - targeted unit tests,
   - preflight pipeline,
   - encoding guard checks.

D) Current priority queue
1. Production parity check against seopro.py on several real domains.
2. Threshold tuning by tab using observed false-positive/false-negative cases.
3. Optional visual refinement (icons in value text where useful, keep performance stable).

E) Known constraints
- Excel visual density is now high; thresholds must be tuned with real-world samples.
- Some historical files still contain legacy mojibake comments, but active report output paths are UTF-8 safe.

F) Start-of-day checklist (next session)
1. Pull latest main and deploy.
2. Run a full Site Audit Pro task and inspect all tab color mappings.
3. Collect 2-3 problematic columns and tune thresholds in one focused commit.
